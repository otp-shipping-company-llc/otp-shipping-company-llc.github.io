## Health Metrics
Using a combination of Python and Obsidian Dataview, I visualized the following metrics times that I have been tracking for over a year:
- Sleep
- Exercise
- Social
- Meditation

I also pulled my Fitbit data and aggregated it to produce even more results on the following metrics:
- Heart Rate
- Heart Rate Zones
- Heart Rate Variability
- Active Zone Minutes and Type
- Activity Minutes
- Steps
- Respiratory Rate
- Sleep Scores
- Stress Scores
- Oxygen Saturation
